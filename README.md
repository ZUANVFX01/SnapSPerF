New update compatible with WebUI

This Magisk module optimizes memory management (VM), CPU, GPU, UFSHC, ZRAM, I/O and kernel performance to improve speed and responsiveness without sacrificing stability.

 With Walt-based tuning and kernel 5.10+, this module ensures the system runs more efficiently, reduces lag, and improves overall performance, especially in multitasking and gaming.
 
 This module is only compatible with Snapdragon devices that support Walt and kernel 5.10 and above. Make sure your device is eligible before installing to get the most out of it!
 
 Not recommended for daily use because disabling thermal heats up your device as a sacrifice for high performance. You also need a maximum cooler.
