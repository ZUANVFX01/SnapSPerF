## SnapSperF Official

New update compatible with WebUI
APK Manager

This Magisk module optimizes memory management (VM), CPU, GPU, UFSHC, ZRAM, I/O and kernel performance to improve speed and responsiveness without sacrificing stability.
 
 Not recommended for daily use because disabling thermal heats up your device as a sacrifice for high performance. You also need a maximum cooler.
